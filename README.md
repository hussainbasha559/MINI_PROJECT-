# 🏦 Bank Personal Loan Prediction

> Predict whether a bank customer will accept a personal loan offer using Machine Learning.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Banks contact thousands of customers with personal loan offers — but only **9.6%** actually accept. This wastes time, money, and resources contacting the wrong people.

**Solution:** Build a Machine Learning model that predicts which customers are likely to accept a loan offer — so the bank can target only the right customers.

## 🎯 What We Predict

| Output | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ Loan Approved | Customer is likely to accept the loan |
| ❌ Loan Not Approved | Customer is likely to reject the loan |

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1 — Install Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2 — Open Jupyter and Run Notebooks in Order
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Run these one by one:
1. `Notebooks/Data_cleaning.ipynb`
2. `Notebooks/EDA.ipynb`
3. `Notebooks/Training.ipynb`
4. `Notebooks/Advanced.ipynb`

> ⚠️ Must run notebooks first — they create the database and model files.

### Step 3 — Start FastAPI 
```bash
uvicorn app.api:app --reload --port 8000
```
API runs at: **https://mini-project-yyii.onrender.com/**

### Step 4 — Start Streamlit 
```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```
App runs at: **https://shaikhussainbashaa9.streamlit.app/**
